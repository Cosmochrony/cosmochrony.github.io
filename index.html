      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Cosmochrony proposes a minimalist ontological starting point: a single relational substrate $\chi$ whose
        dynamics are intrinsically irreversible. Time is not introduced as an external parameter, but corresponds to a
        directed relaxation (ordering) structure of $\chi$.
      </p>
      <p>
        A structural necessity result follows from minimal operational assumptions
        (ontological uniqueness and effective observability): an injective projection
        from the relational substrate to spacetime observables cannot support
        non-trivial holonomy. Emergent gravitational dynamics therefore require
        non-injective projection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bounded relaxation fluxes act as a universal structural constraint.
        The saturation bound on relaxation gradients selects a unique admissible
        infrared encoding and excludes pathological configurations in which the
        projection collapses locally to injectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within this constrained structure, emergent gravity is not postulated
        but follows from the combination of non-injective projection and bounded
        relaxation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A central distinction is drawn between the fundamental substrate $\chi$ and effective spacetime-level
        descriptions, collectively denoted $\chi_{\text{eff}}$. These effective descriptors are meaningful only in
        projectable regimes, where stable geometric and causal notions can be consistently defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        The projection from $\chi$ to effective observables is generally <strong>non-injective</strong>: distinct
        underlying configurations may correspond to operationally indistinguishable spacetime events or measurements.
        This introduces an intrinsic distinction between what is <em>observable</em> and what is <em>resolvable</em>:
        some structural degrees of freedom can be physically real while remaining irreconstructible “under the hood”
        within $\chi_{\text{eff}}$.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spacetime geometry is treated as an effective encoding of relational connectivity. In admissible regimes,
        spectral criteria and Laplacian-based reconstruction provide a concrete, operational pathway from relational
        structure to emergent metric notions, while predicting breakdown outside projectable domains.
      </p>
      <p>Dynamical laws are not postulated at the substrate level, but arise from universal structural constraints on
        relaxation and projection. In projectable regimes, the effective action admits a Born–Infeld-like form, selected
        as a canonical encoding of bounded relaxation fluxes and causal saturation. This non-linear encoding is selected
        by the saturation bound on relaxation gradients, which plays a dual role of ultraviolet completion and infrared
        uniqueness constraint. This action is not fundamental to $\chi$, but an auxiliary representation valid within
        effective spacetime descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The framework further introduces a <strong>projective thermodynamics</strong>: irreversibility and macroscopic
        arrows of time are tied not only to relaxation, but also to a projection entropy associated with non-injective
        identification of underlying states. In this view, effective heating, dissipation, and “thermodynamic” behavior
        can reflect projection saturation and informational degeneracy, not merely microscopic agitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stable localized configurations of $\chi$ give rise to matter-like excitations, while topological and relaxation
        constraints underpin effective interactions. In particular, electric charge is interpreted as a chiral–torsional
        invariant of relaxation fluxes, with admissibility constraints favoring neutral large-scale sectors and
        pair-creation-like restoration mechanisms in extreme regimes.
