      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Cosmochrony proposes a minimalist ontological starting point: a single relational substrate <span class="mono">χ</span> whose dynamics are intrinsically irreversible. In this view, time is not a primitive external parameter; it is associated with a directed relaxation (ordering) structure of <span class="mono">χ</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key distinction is made between the fundamental substrate <span class="mono">χ</span> and the spacetime-level effective descriptor <span class="mono">χ<sub>eff</sub></span>. The latter is a coarse-grained projection used when a stable geometric regime exists. This projection is generally <strong>non-injective</strong>, meaning distinct underlying structures can correspond to the same (or operationally indistinguishable) effective spacetime description.
      </p>
      <p>
        The framework aims to derive dynamical laws from structural constraints on relaxation, and to recover familiar physics as regime-dependent effective descriptions. In particular, the effective action takes a Born–Infeld-like form selected by causal saturation of relaxation fluxes, while spacetime geometry is recovered as a continuum encoding of microscopic connectivity (via spectral reconstruction in appropriate limits).

      <h2>Core statements (high level)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Single-substrate ontology:</strong> the framework centers on one pre-geometric relational entity <span class="mono">χ</span>, not a field propagating on a pre-existing spacetime manifold.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Projection hierarchy:</strong> familiar spacetime quantities are expressed through an effective descriptor <span class="mono">χ<sub>eff</sub></span> that is meaningful only in projectable regimes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-injectivity and limits of reconstruction:</strong> the mapping <span class="mono">χ → χ<sub>eff</sub></span> is generally non-injective; effective observables can underdetermine the underlying configuration, constraining what can be inferred “under the hood.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intrinsic irreversibility:</strong> the relaxation/ordering of <span class="mono">χ</span> is directed; time ordering is associated with this direction rather than introduced as an external variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Derived dynamics:</strong> the dynamical law and the effective Born–Infeld-like action are obtained from structural constraints on relaxation and causal saturation of fluxes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergent geometry from connectivity:</strong> spacetime geometry is recovered as a continuum encoding of microscopic relational connectivity, accessed through spectral methods in appropriate limits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Localized excitations and spectra:</strong> stable localized configurations correspond to matter-like excitations characterized by spectral stability signatures, with effective phenomenology depending on regime and projectability.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The manuscript distinguishes proven constructions, effective-limit results, and conjectural implications; this page mirrors that intent at a high level.

      <h2>Key distinctions (operational)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong><span class="mono">χ</span> vs <span class="mono">χ<sub>eff</sub></span>:</strong> <span class="mono">χ</span> is fundamental and relational; <span class="mono">χ<sub>eff</sub></span> is an effective scalar descriptor used once a geometric regime exists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><span class="mono">c<sub>χ</sub></span> vs <span class="mono">c</span>:</strong> <span class="mono">c<sub>χ</sub></span> denotes the structural bound associated with pre-temporal relaxation fluxes, while <span class="mono">c</span> is the emergent causal constraint within the effective spacetime description.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Projection vs deprojection:</strong> projectability defines when spacetime observables are well-defined; near deprojection thresholds, effective descriptions can become fragile and must be treated with care.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fundamental vs effective quanta:</strong> the manuscript discusses how quantum-like discreteness and constants arise at the effective level, tied to stability spectra and projection structure.

    <h2>What the framework aims to recover (as effective limits)</h2>
    <p>
      Cosmochrony treats familiar physics as regime-dependent effective descriptions of <span class="mono">χ</span> dynamics, expected to hold under stability, locality, and projectability conditions. The manuscript develops how gravitational and field-like phenomena can arise as complementary effective manifestations of relaxation constraints and their modulations.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>General-relativistic behavior as a thermodynamic/continuum limit of relational connectivity, with geometry encoding microscopic structure.</li>
      <li>Field-like dynamics and wave propagation as effective descriptions of organized relaxation modulations in projectable regimes.</li>
      <li>Quantum-like phenomena as effective discreteness tied to stability spectra, projection constraints, and non-factorizable regimes.</li>
      <li>Strong-gravity regimes (including horizon-like thresholds) as domains where projection/deprojection structure becomes central for effective observables.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      The detailed statements, assumptions, and derivations are in the preprint; this list summarizes the intended effective-limit recoveries.

    <h2>Possible implications and avenues for tests</h2>
    <p>
      The preprint identifies directions where quantitative development could yield falsifiable constraints. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Connections between relaxation dynamics and effective cosmological behavior (Hubble-like limits under homogeneous approximations).</li>
      <li>Conditions under which quantum-like correlations emerge from shared configurations (holistic, non-factorizable regimes) and how non-injectivity bounds reconstruction.</li>
      <li>Regimes where deviations from standard cosmological scenarios might arise due to projectability structure or relaxation constraints.</li>
      <li>Strong-gravity regimes near deprojection thresholds, potentially affecting effective wave propagation and observables.</li>
      <li>Spectral/numerical programs aiming to extract stability spectra and evaluate whether effective invariants can be recovered across regimes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="small">
      Turning these directions into robust predictions requires explicit modelling, parameter estimation, and confrontation with data, as emphasized in the manuscript.
